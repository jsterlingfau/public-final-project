# Web Development Final Project - *Brainwave*

Submitted by: **Jayda Sterling**

This web app: **Brainwave is a platform where students can create and share posts all for academia. It includes features such as creating new posts, displaying posts on a feed, and allowing users to interact with posts by leaving comments. Users can also view individual post pages to see additional details such as post content, images, and comments**

Time spent: **336** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **A create form that allows the user to create posts**
- [X] **Posts have a title and optionally additional textual content and/or an image added as an external image URL**
- [X] **A home feed displaying previously created posts**
- [X] **By default, the time created, title, and number of upvotes for each post is shown on the feed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

I made my app mobile friendly and different montior size friendly. The "Hamburger Menu" I implemented is only visble to mobile users and those on a smaller monitor display.

## Notes

This was a long process creating this app I'm just so happy that it is complete and I am very pleased by the outcome. I started over this project about 4 times because I didn't like the direction I was going with but then the idea of Brainwave came and it's been smooth sailing since.
